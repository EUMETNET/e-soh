            "description": "collection of observations from weather stations situated in European countries. Data from synoptic stations and additional stations from 3rd party station holders is distributed with best possible time resolution.  All parameters resolved in the CF-standards could be distributed. The number of parameters differs pr station. Observations from the last 24hours is available for download from EDR-api. Timestamp for each observations is based on observation time, or the end of a aggregation period. Depending om the method used to produce the parameter. All timestamps is given as UTC. Timeliness of the data depends on when it is distributed from the NMS. Timeliness within the system is 1 minute after reception time at the E-soh ingestor. Observations in E-soh is initial received at one of the NWS'es. The NMS is responsible for checking the quality of the observations. The NMS is also responsible for collection and distribution of metadata compliant to E-soh and WIS-2.0. E-soh also include all global observations distributed over the Global Transition System (GTS) that is considered as open and free for use. E-soh aims to serve all data according to FAIR principles.
