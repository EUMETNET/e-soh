Some relevant tasks for the datastore.
Should probably be organized in a different form/tool and also in a timeline with milestones etc. ...

---------------------------

- establish a test dataset (~24 hours of realistic obs data that we could benchmark against)

- decide on language (Go vs Python?)

- define a REST API to support CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) relevant in our case
  - writing obs values
  - reading obs values

- decide what metadata should be supported for:
  - time series as a whole (regardless of obs time - e.g. location of sensor, overall quality of sensor)
  - individual obs value (e.g. obs quality)

- decide standard/format/vocabulary of metadata
  - ACDD ?
  - CF ?
  - ...

- should we support movable sensors?

- decide level of testing and how to run tests
  - unit tests (necessary in our case?)
  - integration tests
  - test dataset (for benchmarking)
  - traffic patterns
  - stress testing
  - ...
